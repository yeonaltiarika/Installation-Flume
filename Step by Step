This Step is based on my setting in Terminal, I hope you know where you HOME DIRECTORY
Firstly you should download apache flume in the official website

or you can type brew install flume

nadess-MBP:~ leeheeyeon$ cd Downloads
nadess-MBP:Downloads leeheeyeon$ tar -xvzf apache-flume-1.7.0-bin.tar.gz

It will extract apache-flume-1.7.0-bin.tar.gz

and then 

nadess-MBP:Downloads leeheeyeon$ open -a Finder /usr/local/bin

your /usr/local/bin will open automatically, it will make easy to put  the apache-flume-1.7.0-bin directory inside the /usr/lib/ directory 

nadess-MBP:Downloads leeheeyeon$ sudo mv apache-flume-1.7.0-bin /usr/local/lib/
Password:(type your password)
nadess-MBP:Downloads leeheeyeon$ 

Download flume-sources-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and put it in library directory of apache flume

Move the flume-sources-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file from Downloads directory to lib directory of apache flume
